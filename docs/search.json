    "text": "A central objective in ecology is to understand how environmental change drives ecological change. The research at the Eccology lab aims to identify how community characteristics, together with the nature of environmental change itself, shape community dynamics and, in turn, determine composition, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning. We pursue this goal by integrating mathematical modelling, theoretical development, the analysis of existing data, and experimental studies using microbial systems."

    "text": "Frederik De Laender\nI am interested in the various connections between environmental change, several aspects of biodiversity, and ecosystem function. I am leading the lab since 2013 as a Professor at the university of Namur.\nLaura Willam\n\nNowadays, ecosystems are subject to an increasing variety of environmental stresses, which can result in biodiversity loss. However, biodiversity plays a key role in maintaining these functions, known as the ‘biodiversity insurance effect’. Nevertheless, few studies have examined the impact of diverse environmental stresses on this effect. This is why my project will examine the combined effects of environmental stresses and biodiversity on algal communities using an experimental and modelling approach. \nBidesh Bera\nArunima Sikder\nMaria Druet\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my PhD project, we investigate how soil saprotrophic fungi respond to heatwaves. I focus on fungal growth, functional traits, and interactions with bacteria in laboratory experiments. The aim is to improve our understanding of fungal ecology under climate change.\nGermain Agazzi\nShangsheng Sun\nEstelle Lechat\nAlexis Orban\nSophie Eischen\nRuth Nies"
